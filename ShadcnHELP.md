To integrate shadcn/ui into your React project using Vite, follow these steps:

Create a New React Project with Vite:

bash
Copy code
npm create vite@latest
Follow the prompts to set up your project.

Install and Configure Tailwind CSS:

bash
Copy code
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
This initializes tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js.

Set Up Tailwind in Your CSS: In your main CSS file (e.g., src/index.css), add:

css
Copy code
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Configure Tailwind's Content Paths: In tailwind.config.js, set the content paths:

javascript
Copy code
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './index.html',
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
Update TypeScript Configuration: In tsconfig.json, add:

json
Copy code
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
Modify Vite Configuration: Install Node.js types:

bash
Copy code
npm install -D @types/node
Then, in vite.config.ts:

typescript
Copy code
import path from 'path';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
});
Initialize shadcn/ui: Run the shadcn/ui initialization command:

bash
Copy code
npx shadcn@latest init
Follow the prompts to configure components.json.

Add Components: To add a component, such as a button:

bash
Copy code
npx shadcn@latest add button
You can then use it in your project:

javascript
Copy code
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
